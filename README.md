# Tour-delirio-salsa-y-vigilancia

**Project Purpose:** To educate Latin American audiences about the surveillance systems operating within their cities.

**Project Responsibilities:** To create an interactive website that allows users to traverse an imaginary city, understanding the interplay between Salsa music and digital surveillance. Work with Harmony Labs to develop and implement an impact plan.

My hometown, Cali, is known as the World's Capital City of Salsa Music. This huge title expresses the close relationship that most people have with rhythm, dance and this popular type of music. A couple of years ago, I started listening and dancing to salsa music with a new perspective. I started paying closer attention to the lyrics, and I realized that not only are some songs very aggressive towards women. but also how the idea of love reflected in the music is very similar to the idea of stalking and control that the digital age has maximized.

**Activities:** I want to create a digital cartography where people can take a musical journey through an imaginary city. This city would be inspired by the happy chaos of some of the largest cities in Latin America such as Bogot√°, Mexico City, Lima, Caracas, or Sao Paulo. What is special about this musical trip? As Professor Gary T. Marx said in his article *Soul Train: The New Surveillance and Popular Music*, there are "close links between surveillance and culture and control and entertainment" following his idea of seeing "musical themes as a window to knowledge about surveillance and society". 

**Whom, where?** I hope that people from Latin America, who are not experts in these topics, can use this musical journey to discover the problems under the surface of the new concepts of smart cities, IoT, and other kinds of concepts that they are part of in the narrative of security and technology. That they have implications in the exercise of our human rights, that is to say, they have a sinister side. The cartography will have key points (places or elements) such as security cameras, bus stations, helicopters, supermarkets, customer cards, etc... all linked with songs that express, in their lyrics, a sense of control, stalking, tracking, and so forth. When a user stops in a particular spot, a song will play and a little text box will show information about a concept related to surveillance and the importance of privacy. The experience of realizing some hidden privacy problems in our cities is similar to the experience I had discovering the hidden narratives in salsa music. 

**Outputs:** A digital cartography as a resource to talk about privacy and surveillance in the Latin American context.

**Impact:** Improve the Latin American population's knowledge of privacy concerns that many of the "technology city plans" represent for citizens.
